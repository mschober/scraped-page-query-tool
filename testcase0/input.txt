Since TPG's most recent valuations peg the value of Chase Ultimate Rewards points at 2 cents apiece, you'll get a fantastic return of 6% on purchases in these categories. If you spend the full $150,000, you'll take home 450,000 Ultimate Rewards points, which TPG values at $9,000. You also get great value out of Chase Ultimate Rewards points by transferring them to nine airline and three hotel loyalty programs. Plus the card gives you 25% more value for the points you earn when you redeem them for travel in the Ultimate Rewards portal.
The Ultimate Rewards program may not have the most transfer partners (it has nine airline and three hotel compared to Amex Membership Rewards 19, including new partner Qantas), but they can get you outsized value when you redeem points for free flights with carriers such as British Airways and United, or for award stays at Hyatt properties. And if you spend a lot on travel or social media advertising, you'll be able to keep earning significant UR points after the sign-up bonus, thanks to the 3x bonus category for the first $150,000 in combined purchases made each year.
For the reasons outlined above, I consider this one of the top business credit cards currently available. The Ink Business Preferred can be an even more powerful tool if you also hold the Chase Sapphire Reserve, since you'll then be able to redeem points for 1.5 cents apiece through the Ultimate Rewards portal for travel. You also get Rewards for this bonus sentence.
